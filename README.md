# Tintri Graphite OpenShift

This repo contains tintri_graphite.py from https://github.com/eric-becker/tintri_graphite/
and tintri_1_1.py from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tintri/tintri-rest-api/master/examples/python/

The goal of this is to make a simple app out of tintri_graphite.py that runs continuously in OpenShift.
